  <h1>Artist statement</h1>

  <p>With a sensitive heart, love for photography, and desire to inspire others, I formulate my work as a source of inspiration, and to trigger the thoughts: “What is the story behind this photograph?” I  want my audience to feel the emotions they see in the image. To empathize with the people they 

see on screen. Looking back on memories—good and bad—I find images that replicate and 

trigger emotions like melancholy, pain, happiness, and love. With a mixture of minimalist, bright 

colors, and a clear picture, I allow myself to create pieces based off personal experiences, which 

in turn create new stories. Raw emotion and simplicity are always my starting points to any new 

piece I create. These create emotions so deep, so personal, so sensitive, into something bold, 

inspiring, and powerful. My main goal is to allow the audience to experience the story themselves, or come up with their own as they watch</p>
